# Password Manager
This is a Password Manager program written in Java. It allows users to store and manage their passwords securely.

## Getting Started
To run this program, follow these steps:

    1. Clone this repository.
    2. Open Eclipse IDE.
    3. Import the project by selecting File > Import > General > Existing Projects into workspace and selecting the cloned repository folder.
    4. Once the project is imported, navigate to the com.example.passwordmanager package in the package Explorer and open the PasswordManager.java file.
    5. Run the program by clicking on the Run button in the toolbar.

## Usage
When the program is run, it will prompt the user to enter a password. The password must meet certain criteria (e.g., minimum length, use of upper and lowercase letters, etc.). If the password is valid, the user will be given options to add a new password, view an existing password, update an existing password, or delete an existing password.

Passwords are stored in a HashMap in the PasswordRepository class. Each password is associated with a unique ID, which is used to retrieve, update, or delete the password.
